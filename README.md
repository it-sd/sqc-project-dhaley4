# Davin's Numbers Site
Davin Haley, dhaley4

Page for displaying messages based on random numbers, 0-4095.
If the generated number is 0, then it outputs "WOAH LUCKY" to the discord.
Otherwise, it outputs "Oof times x" with x being the number generated.
Simplified from the original idea, due to the simplification of the final project requirements.

I will be using the font SpaceType.

I chose the above colors because blue is usually a very conforting color, and can help promote a positive user experience without being overwhelmingly bright.
